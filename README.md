# Real-Time Facial Recognition App

## About the Project

This project demonstrates a real-time facial recognition application built using React, Vite, TypeScript, and TensorFlow\.js. By utilizing the BlazeFace model from TensorFlow\.js, this app detects faces in a webcam feed and draws bounding boxes around them, providing a lightweight and efficient face detection solution.

## Features

- **Real-Time Face Detection**: Detect faces in a live webcam feed with high accuracy and low latency.
- **Lightweight and Fast**: Powered by the BlazeFace model, optimized for speed and efficiency.
- **Modern Stack**: Developed using React, Vite, and TypeScript for a scalable and developer-friendly architecture.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:suhasmanjunath/react-ts-realtime-facial-recognition.git
   cd react-ts-realtime-facial-recognition
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`.

## How It Works

1. The app uses the `react-webcam` package to access the user's webcam.
2. TensorFlow\.js loads the BlazeFace model to detect faces in real-time.
3. Detected faces are outlined with bounding boxes drawn on an overlaid `<canvas>` element.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Vite**: For a fast development environment.
- **TypeScript**: For type-safe development.
- **TensorFlow\.js**: For face detection with the BlazeFace model.
- **react-webcam**: For accessing webcam streams.
